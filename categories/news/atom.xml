    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://monupco.com">Monupco</a> is pleased to announce the general availability
of our updates monitoring service. Monupco provides user friendly interface to
monitor available updates for your cloud applications and information about different
package versions.</p>

<p>At the time of launch Monupco supports registration of Python applications hosted
on Red Hat's <a href="http://openshift.redhat.com">OpenShift Express</a> platform. Client side
tools and installation information can be found at our
<a href="https://github.com/monupco/monupco-openshift-express-python">GitHub page</a>.</p>

<p>Monupco itself is developed and hosted in the cloud and we're working to support
additional cloud vendors and programming languages so stay tuned for more news.
We're encouraging all early adopters to send us their feedback and feature requests
via <a href="http://twitter.com/monupco">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://github.com/monupco/monupco.github.com/issues/new">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>While the service is operating normally it has limited support for cloud vendors and
package types and is considered an alpha release. Monupco will remain free of
charge during its Alpha and Beta periods.</p>

<p>Registration and login into our management console is straight forward using
credentials from several popular social networking providers.</p>
