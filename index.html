            <br /><br />
        
    

    
        <div class="entry-content"><p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce our new dashboard
and the ability to follow packages without registering applications. Read
below for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Latest Releases</strong></p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/new_dashboard/releases.png" title="Latest Releases" alt="Latest Releases" /></p>

<p>The default dashboard page is showing a news stream of all latest releases
for packages the user is following or using inside applications.</p>

<p><strong>Change History</strong></p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/new_dashboard/change_history.png" title="Change History" alt="Change History" /></p>

<p>This page is showing a news stream of change analysis between multiple package
versions that the user is following or using inside applications. As shown in this
example the user is following <code>bundler-1.2.1</code> and <code>bundler-1.2.3</code> while the latest
available is <code>bundler-1.3.0</code> and <code>bundler-1.2.5</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Follow Packages</strong></p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/new_dashboard/follow.png" title="Follow Packages" alt="Follow Packages" /></p>

<p>A new page to view and search packages is now available. Users can follow or unfollow
any packages and versions they want through the buttons. Simple color codes
distinguish between different states: green - user is following version;
gray - version is used inside registered application; transparent - not following version.
Versions which are used inside applications can only be removed/unfollowed by deleting
the entire application, or deleting the package from the application.
For example <code>Pygments-1.5</code> is been used in an application, but <code>Pygments-1.6</code> is been
followed manually.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended to follow a particular version, not only the package name.
If a user decides to follow only package name, but not versions, Difio will not be
able to generate change analysis reports because there&#8217;s no
basis to compare to. In this case the user will be able to see only the latest
releases news stream.</p>

<p><strong>Applications</strong></p>

<p>This page is showing all registered applications for which Difio is monitoring dependencies.
This page has been available previously and also includes the improvements
<a href="/blog/blog/2013/02/21/new-look-feel-application-info-pages/">announced last week</a>.
Small speed improvements have been made to this page as well.</p>

<p><strong>Invite Friends</strong></p>

<p>This is an interactive dialog which allows you to invite your fellows to try Difio.
It only asks for the email addresses of your friends and sends them an invitation.
We do not keep track of these addresses nor send any spam to them.</p>

<hr />

<p>We encourage developers from all supported backgrounds and
languages to <a href="https://difio-otb.rhcloud.com/dashboard/follow/">start following packages</a>
and send us their feedback via <a href="https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new">GitHub</a>
or <a href="https://twitter.com/DifioNews">Twitter</a>.</p>

            <br /><br />
        
    

    
        <div class="entry-content"><p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce new look and feel
for application info pages. Difio keeps track of application
dependencies and tells you when they change. We let you inspect the
changes and make informed decision when or what to upgrade.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/new_app_info.png" title="App Info page" alt="App Info Page" /></p>

<p>Previously the application info page was showing only the latest available
updates. This made it hard for users to inspect older updates.
For example if you had Django-1.4.3 you would see the
latest Django-1.4.5 but not 1.4.4.</p>

<p>For packages which maintain several active branches it was not possible to
compare installed version against stable branch versions. It was always compared
to the latest from the master branch.
For example if you had ffi-1.3.0 you could not see ffi-1.3.1 but
would see ffi-1.4.0 instead.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s release fixes this by offering the user all available updates to
their packages. In addition change rate icons are replaced by color codes.
The version string is now shown as a button in one of the standard colors
green (low), orange (medium) or red (high). Improvement has been made to
the page load speed as well. It is now significantly faster.</p>

<p>Email notifications still display only the highest available version.
This will be changed soon to include intermediate versions.
At the moment information about intermediate versions is available only
via the web interface or <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/difio/updates">RSS</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage developers from all backgrounds and
languages to <a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">register</a> their applications and
send us their feedback via <a href="https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new">GitHub</a>

        <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://sofiavalley.com">SofiaValley</a> is a Bulgarian blog focused on the
IT life in the Sofia valley :). Today they announced a new section called
SV startups which will be focusing on startups and interesting projects in
the region.</p>

<p>We are happy that Difio is the first startup to be featured on their website
and hope that there will be many others. Kudos to SofiaValley!</p>

            <br /><br />
        
    

    
        <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello guys! We haven&#8217;t posted in a while and we&#8217;re sorry for this. Here&#8217;s an idea which is
going around in our heads. Let us know what do you think.</p>

<h2>Tabular View</h2>

<p>Currently when you log into the <a href="https://difio-otb.rhcloud.com/applications/mine/">application dashboard</a>
and navigate to the details view of each application you see this:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/appdetails.png" title="Tabular view" alt="Tabular view" /></p>

<p>The installed packages are on the left while new versions are on the right. The links point to
more detailed information about changes between the two versions. By default only the
available updates are shown but you can display all installed packages as well.</p>

<p>We also have a history page which holds a snapshot of your installed dependencies
whenever they change. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/history_records.png" title="History records" alt="History records" /></p>

<p>These two pages inform you about the latest and greatest versions
and which ones you have been using in the past. However they don&#8217;t show you
any version release history nor how does your application relate to that.</p>

<h2>Graphical View</h2>

<p>Our proposal is to implement a graphical view as shown on the mock-up below:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/app_graph.png" title="Graphical view" alt="Graphical view" /></p>

<p>On the vertical axis are all the dependencies used by your application. By default only outdated
ones are shown, sorted by their name for readability.</p>

<p>On the horizontal axis are all available versions for that particular package shown as markers.
A tooltip shows you the package name and version. Density and scale is based on release dates.
Zoom will help you investigate more closely.</p>

<p>The marker or the tooltip can be a link to the standard page where these two versions are compared and analyzed.
The marker icon can be left as is or be one of the icons representing Low, Medium or High change rate.</p>

<p>Individual packages can be turned on or off of course.</p>

<p>Application state is shown as a line connecting the versions you have installed. Previous states, where dependency
versions were different can be represented as similar lines on the left. The leftmost being the oldest history record.
State lines can also be turned on or off if the view gets too crowded.</p>

<h2>You Vote, We Code</h2>

<p>The ball is yours now! If this page gets over 50 tweets, comments, shares or likes we are going to implement this in <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>.
A breakdown of features will be posted in the comments below. Please vote up or down for any of them.
Features that get promoted will be implemented.</p>

<p>If you have any other ideas or suggestions please let us know. You can use the comments form or submit them
via <a href="https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/DifioNews">Twitter</a>.</p>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce
support for tracking application history. Difio keeps track of application
dependencies and tells you when they change. We let you inspect the
changes and make informed decision when or what to upgrade.</p>

<p>Our team has added a new feature to track changes in the list of
dependencies used by applications. Every time you upgrade, add or remove a
package from your application dependencies Difio creates a history record.
As always, don&#8217;t forget to re-run the registration script or to manually refresh
your apps after changing the dependencies!</p>

<p>Every application starts with a single history record, reflecting its latest state.
Later you can review your app history and revert to previously used versions
for example. Difio is planning to add more goodies to the history page in a future
release. If you have an idea and want us to implement it, please post it on the
<a href="http://www.dif.io/#ideas">ideas dashboard</a>!</p>

<p>This new functionality is accessible on the application details view via the
<em>Last check-in</em> hyperlink, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/apphistory.png" title="Link to history page" alt="Link to history page" /></p>

<p>We encourage developers from all backgrounds and languages to <a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">register</a>

            <br /><br />
        
    

    
        <div class="entry-content"><p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce version 1.9
of our dependencies monitoring service. Difio keeps track of application
dependencies and tells you when they change. We let you inspect the
changes and make informed decision when or what to upgrade.</p>

<p>This release includes several new features and website updates.</p>

<h2>API diff</h2>

<p>The <em>API diff</em> feature is exploring packages source code and builds their
API definitions. Then definitions between your currently installed package
and the latest upstream version are compared. Changes are presented as a
colored diff format for better readability.</p>

<p><em>API diff</em> is accessible through the main update view, next to changelog,
commit log and bugs list as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/api_diff.png" title="API diff example" alt="API diff example" /></p>

<p><em>API diff</em> is initially available only for Python. For Python we support
detection of class definitions, function definitions and decorators.</p>

<p>Example showing no API changes can be seen with a recent
<a href="http://www.dif.io/updates/MySQL-python-1.2.4b5/MySQL-python-1.2.4c1/8439/">MySQL-python release</a>.</p>

<p>Example showing new classes being added and some functions changing can be
seen with a recent
<a href="http://www.dif.io/updates/django-social-auth-0.7.7/django-social-auth-0.7.9/8791/">django-social-auth release</a>.</p>

<p><em>API diff</em> support for other languages will be added in future releases!</p>

<h2>Refresh manually imported apps</h2>

<p>It is now possible to refresh the dependency list for manually imported applications.
Simply click the <em>Refresh</em> button as shown below and import the dependency list again.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/refresh_app.png" title="Refresh button" alt="Refresh button" /></p>

<p>The refresh functionality has always been present for all of our PaaS
<a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">registration agents</a>.</p>

<h2>Share the package list</h2>

<p>When you need to match your dev environment with the production one, or
ensure dependency similarity between multiple nodes you need the
list of already installed packages.</p>

<p>In this release Difio adds a new button labeled <em>Package List</em> which exports
all installed dependencies as plain text. The format is name==version.
You can share this list with other developers as needed.</p>

<h2>Minor improvements and bug fixes</h2>

<p>We have also done lots of minor improvements and fixes to our website.
They are invisible to the naked eye so no need to tell you more :).</p>

<p>We encourage developers from all backgrounds and languages to <a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">register</a>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce initial
support for <a href="http://cloudcontrol.com">cloudControl</a>. Difio provides insight of available
updates for open source components. It lets you inspect changes and take
informed decision when or what to upgrade. This improves software life cycle
planning and minimizes possible regressions and downtime.</p>

<p>We have added two new registration scripts allowing <em>cloudControl</em> developers to
subscribe their applications to Difio. At the moment there is support for
<a href="https://github.com/difio/difio-cloudcontrol-python/blob/master/README.rst">Python</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/difio/difio-cloudcontrol-ruby/blob/master/README.md">Ruby</a>
programming languages. Difio is working together with <em>cloudControl</em> to add support
for Java and PHP as well, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>We encourage developers who use <em>cloudControl</em> to <a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">register</a>
their applications and send us their feedback via <a href="https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new">GitHub</a>

        <div class="entry-content"><p>The folks at <a href="http://xeround.com">Xeround</a> have compiled a pretty good list of
<a href="http://xeround.com/blog/2012/08/43-free-cloud-resources-for-application-developers">43 cloud computing services</a>
that can make life easier for application developers – all free of charge.
The list is organized by categories: cloud IDEs, source code management,
issue tracking, cloud and open source databases, CMS, payment gateways,
IaaS and PaaS, load testing, monitoring, knowledge base and web analytics.</p>

<p>They are missing some vendors however. Here&#8217;s a list of some resources that <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>
is using:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://openshift.redhat.com">OpenShift</a> - PaaS platform by <em>Red Hat</em> which is our primary resource;</li>
<li><a href="http://dotcloud.com">dotCloud</a> - another PaaS service;</li>
<li><a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> - a popular PaaS vendor, especially among Ruby developers;</li>
<li><a href="http://twillio.com">Twillio</a> - cloud communications service.</li>
<li><a href="http://hpcloud.com">HP Cloud</a> - IaaS vendor that runs on <a href="http://linux-kvm.org">KVM</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>We&#8217;re especially interested in what other PaaS platforms developers are using. Please let us know
what is your programming language and platform in the comments!</p>
