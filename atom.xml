    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2013/02/21/new-look-feel-application-info-pages/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-21T00:42:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2013/02/21/new-look-feel-application-info-pages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce new look and feel
for application info pages. Difio keeps track of application
dependencies and tells you when they change. We let you inspect the
changes and make informed decision when or what to upgrade.</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/new_app_info.png" title="App Info page" alt="App Info Page" /></p>

<p>Previously the application info page was showing only the latest available
updates. This made it hard for users to inspect older updates.
For example if you had Django-1.4.3 you would see the
latest Django-1.4.5 but not 1.4.4.</p>

<p>For packages which maintain several active branches it was not possible to
compare installed version against stable branch versions. It was always compared
to the latest from the master branch.
For example if you had ffi-1.3.0 you could not see ffi-1.3.1 but
would see ffi-1.4.0 instead.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s release fixes this by offering the user all available updates to
their packages. In addition change rate icons are replaced by color codes.
The version string is now shown as a button in one of the standard colors
green (low), orange (medium) or red (high). Improvement has been made to
the page load speed as well. It is now significantly faster.</p>

<p>Email notifications still display only the highest available version.
This will be changed soon to include intermediate versions.
At the moment information about intermediate versions is available only
via the web interface or <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/difio/updates">RSS</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage developers from all backgrounds and
languages to <a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">register</a> their applications and
send us their feedback via <a href="https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new">GitHub</a>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sofiavalley.com">SofiaValley</a> is a Bulgarian blog focused on the
IT life in the Sofia valley :). Today they announced a new section called
SV startups which will be focusing on startups and interesting projects in
the region.</p>

<p>We are happy that Difio is the first startup to be featured on their website
and hope that there will be many others. Kudos to SofiaValley!</p>

    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2013/01/24/graphical-or-tabular-view-you-vote-we-code/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-24T14:43:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2013/01/24/graphical-or-tabular-view-you-vote-we-code</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello guys! We haven&#8217;t posted in a while and we&#8217;re sorry for this. Here&#8217;s an idea which is
going around in our heads. Let us know what do you think.</p>

<h2>Tabular View</h2>

<p>Currently when you log into the <a href="https://difio-otb.rhcloud.com/applications/mine/">application dashboard</a>
and navigate to the details view of each application you see this:</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/appdetails.png" title="Tabular view" alt="Tabular view" /></p>

<p>The installed packages are on the left while new versions are on the right. The links point to
more detailed information about changes between the two versions. By default only the
available updates are shown but you can display all installed packages as well.</p>

<p>We also have a history page which holds a snapshot of your installed dependencies
whenever they change. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/history_records.png" title="History records" alt="History records" /></p>

<p>These two pages inform you about the latest and greatest versions
and which ones you have been using in the past. However they don&#8217;t show you
any version release history nor how does your application relate to that.</p>

<h2>Graphical View</h2>

<p>Our proposal is to implement a graphical view as shown on the mock-up below:</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/app_graph.png" title="Graphical view" alt="Graphical view" /></p>

<p>On the vertical axis are all the dependencies used by your application. By default only outdated
ones are shown, sorted by their name for readability.</p>

<p>On the horizontal axis are all available versions for that particular package shown as markers.
A tooltip shows you the package name and version. Density and scale is based on release dates.
Zoom will help you investigate more closely.</p>

<p>The marker or the tooltip can be a link to the standard page where these two versions are compared and analyzed.
The marker icon can be left as is or be one of the icons representing Low, Medium or High change rate.</p>

<p>Individual packages can be turned on or off of course.</p>

<p>Application state is shown as a line connecting the versions you have installed. Previous states, where dependency
versions were different can be represented as similar lines on the left. The leftmost being the oldest history record.
State lines can also be turned on or off if the view gets too crowded.</p>

<h2>You Vote, We Code</h2>

<p>The ball is yours now! If this page gets over 50 tweets, comments, shares or likes we are going to implement this in <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>.
A breakdown of features will be posted in the comments below. Please vote up or down for any of them.
Features that get promoted will be implemented.</p>

<p>If you have any other ideas or suggestions please let us know. You can use the comments form or submit them
via <a href="https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/DifioNews">Twitter</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2012/11/27/difio-adds-application-history-tracking/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-27T23:04:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2012/11/27/difio-adds-application-history-tracking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce
support for tracking application history. Difio keeps track of application
dependencies and tells you when they change. We let you inspect the
changes and make informed decision when or what to upgrade.</p>

<p>Our team has added a new feature to track changes in the list of
dependencies used by applications. Every time you upgrade, add or remove a
package from your application dependencies Difio creates a history record.
As always, don&#8217;t forget to re-run the registration script or to manually refresh
your apps after changing the dependencies!</p>

<p>Every application starts with a single history record, reflecting its latest state.
Later you can review your app history and revert to previously used versions
for example. Difio is planning to add more goodies to the history page in a future
release. If you have an idea and want us to implement it, please post it on the
<a href="http://www.dif.io/#ideas">ideas dashboard</a>!</p>

<p>This new functionality is accessible on the application details view via the
<em>Last check-in</em> hyperlink, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/apphistory.png" title="Link to history page" alt="Link to history page" /></p>

    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2012/11/14/difio-1.9-release-announcement/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-14T10:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2012/11/14/difio-1.9-release-announcement</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce version 1.9
of our dependencies monitoring service. Difio keeps track of application
dependencies and tells you when they change. We let you inspect the
changes and make informed decision when or what to upgrade.</p>

<p>This release includes several new features and website updates.</p>

<h2>API diff</h2>

<p>The <em>API diff</em> feature is exploring packages source code and builds their
API definitions. Then definitions between your currently installed package
and the latest upstream version are compared. Changes are presented as a
colored diff format for better readability.</p>

<p><em>API diff</em> is accessible through the main update view, next to changelog,
commit log and bugs list as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/api_diff.png" title="API diff example" alt="API diff example" /></p>

<p><em>API diff</em> is initially available only for Python. For Python we support
detection of class definitions, function definitions and decorators.</p>

<p>Example showing no API changes can be seen with a recent
<a href="http://www.dif.io/updates/MySQL-python-1.2.4b5/MySQL-python-1.2.4c1/8439/">MySQL-python release</a>.</p>

<p>Example showing new classes being added and some functions changing can be
seen with a recent
<a href="http://www.dif.io/updates/django-social-auth-0.7.7/django-social-auth-0.7.9/8791/">django-social-auth release</a>.</p>

<p><em>API diff</em> support for other languages will be added in future releases!</p>

<h2>Refresh manually imported apps</h2>

<p>It is now possible to refresh the dependency list for manually imported applications.
Simply click the <em>Refresh</em> button as shown below and import the dependency list again.</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/refresh_app.png" title="Refresh button" alt="Refresh button" /></p>

<p>The refresh functionality has always been present for all of our PaaS
<a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">registration agents</a>.</p>

<h2>Share the package list</h2>

<p>When you need to match your dev environment with the production one, or
ensure dependency similarity between multiple nodes you need the
list of already installed packages.</p>

<p>In this release Difio adds a new button labeled <em>Package List</em> which exports
all installed dependencies as plain text. The format is name==version.
You can share this list with other developers as needed.</p>

<h2>Minor improvements and bug fixes</h2>

<p>We have also done lots of minor improvements and fixes to our website.
They are invisible to the naked eye so no need to tell you more :).</p>

<p>We encourage developers from all backgrounds and languages to <a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">register</a>
their applications and send us their feedback via <a href="https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new">GitHub</a>

IaaS and PaaS, load testing, monitoring, knowledge base and web analytics.</p>

<p>They are missing some vendors however. Here&#8217;s a list of some resources that <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>
is using:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://openshift.redhat.com">OpenShift</a> - PaaS platform by <em>Red Hat</em> which is our primary resource;</li>
<li><a href="http://dotcloud.com">dotCloud</a> - another PaaS service;</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce version 1.5
of our updates monitoring service. Difio provides insight of available
updates for open source components. It lets you inspect changes and take
informed decision when or what to upgrade. This improves software life cycle
planning and minimizes possible regressions and downtime.</p>

<p>This release adds support for <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PHP PEAR</a> packages and
new registration agents for <a href="http://dotcloud.com">dotCloud</a> and
<a href="http://openshift.redhat.com">OpenShift</a> PHP applications. See
<a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">how to register applications</a> page for more information.
Currently only packages from <a href="http://pear.php.net">http://pear.php.net</a> channel are supported.
We&#8217;re working on enabling additional channels like <a href="http://pecl.php.net">PECL</a>
and self hosted PEAR channels.</p>

<p>In addition to popular package index directories there are many projects which
are distributed directly and not via package index. We&#8217;ve made a first step towards
supporting such projects. This release adds support for projects which are
distributed directly from <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. At the moment support is limited
to projects which use tags.</p>

<p>Our web site now supports search functionality via Google custom search.</p>

<p>In the next releases we&#8217;re going to add registration agents for more cloud/PaaS vendors

    <updated>2012-05-19T16:58:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2012/05/19/cross-domain-ajax-served-from-cdn</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week Amazon <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/05/amazon-cloudfront-support-for-dynamic-content.html">announced</a>
support for dynamic content in their CDN solution <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/"><em>Amazon CloudFront</em></a>.
The announce coincided with my efforts to migrate more pieces of <em>Difio</em>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dif.io">website</a> to <em>CloudFront</em>.</p>

<p>In this article I will not talk about hosting static files on CDN. This is easy and I&#8217;ve already written
about it <a href="http://dif.io/blog/2012/04/17/using-openshift-as-amazon-cloudfront-origin-server/">here</a>. I will show how to
cache AJAX(JSONP actually) responses and serve them directly from <em>Amazon CloudFront</em>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>For those if you who may not be familiar (are there any) CDN stands for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">Content Delivery Network</a>. In short
this employs numerous servers with identical content. The requests from the browser are served
from the location which gives best performance for the user. This is used by all major websites
to speed-up static content like images, video, CSS and JavaScript files.</p>

<p>AJAX means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</a>.
This is what Google uses to create dynamic user interface which doesn&#8217;t require to reload the page.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p><em>Difio</em> has two web interfaces. The primary one is a static HTML website
which employs JavaScript for the dynamic areas. It is hosted on the dif.io domain.
The other one is powered by Django and provides the same interface plus the
<a href="https://difio-otb.rhcloud.com/applications/mine/">applications dashboard</a> and several API functions
which don&#8217;t have a visible user interface. This is under the *.rhcloud.com domain b/c it is hosted on
<a href="http://openshift.redhat.com"><em>OpenShift</em></a>.</p>

<p>The present state of the website is the result of rapid development using conventional methods -
HTML templates and server-side processing. This is migrating to modern web technology like static HTML
and JavaScript while the server side will remain pure API service.</p>

<p>For this migration to happen I need the HTML pages at dif.io to execute JavaScript and load information
which comes from the rhcloud.com domain. Unfortunately this is not easily doable with AJAX because
of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">Same origin policy</a> in browsers.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using the <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/"><em>Dojo Toolkit</em></a> JavaScript framework which has a solution.
It&#8217;s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a>. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>

<pre><code>     dif.io ------ JSONP request --&gt; abc.rhcloud.com --v
        ^                                              |
        |                                              |
    JavaScript processing                              |
        |                                              |
        +------------------ JSONP response ------------+
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty standard configuration for a web service.</p>

<h2>Going to the clouds</h2>

<p>The way <em>Dojo</em> implements JSONP is through the
<a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.7/dojo/io/script.html">dojo.io.script</a> module.
It works by appending a query string parameter of the form <em>?callback=funcName</em> which the server uses
to generate the JSONP response. This callback name is dynamically generated by <em>Dojo</em> based on the order
in which your call to <em>dojo.io.script</em> is executed.</p>

<p>Until recently <em>Amazon CloudFront</em> ignored all query string parameters when requesting the content from
the origin server. Without the query string it was not possible to generate the JSONP response.
Luckily Amazon resolved the issue only one day after I asked about it on their forums.</p>

<p>Now <em>Amazon CloudFront</em> will use the URL path and the query string parameters to identify the objects in cache.
To enable this edit the CloudFront distribution <em>behavior(s)</em> and set <em>Forward Query Strings</em> to Yes.</p>

<p>When a visitor of the website requests the data <em>Amazon CloudFront</em> will use exactly the same url path and query strings
to fetch the content from the origin server. All that I had to do is switch the domain of the JSONP service
to point to the cloudfront.net domain. It became like this:</p>

<pre><code>                                                        | Everything on this side is handled by Amazon.
                                                        | No code required!
                                                        |
     dif.io ------ JSONP request --&gt; xyz.cloudfront.net -- JSONP request if cache miss --&gt; abc.rhcloud.com --v
        ^                              |                ^                                                    |
        |                              |                |                                                    |
    JavaScript processing              |                +---------- JSONP response --------------------------+
        |                              |
        +---- cached JSONP response ---+
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the website structure and code didn&#8217;t change at all. All that changed was a single domain name.</p>

<h2>Controlling the cache</h2>

<p><em>Amazon CloudFront</em> will keep the contents in cache based on the origin headers if present or the manual configuration
from the AWS Console. To work around frequent requests to the origin server it is considered best practice to set the
Expires header to a value far in the future, like 1 year.
However if the content changes you need some way to tell <em>CloudFront</em> about it. The most commonly used method is through
using different URLs to access the same content. This will cause <em>CloudFront</em> to cache the content under the new location
while keeping the old content until it expires.</p>

<p><em>Dojo</em> makes this very easy:</p>

<pre><code>    require(["dojo/io/script"],
        function(script) {
                script.get({
                    url: "https://xyz.cloudfront.net/api/json/updates/1234",
                    callbackParamName: "callback",
                    content: {t: timeStamp},
                    load: function(jsonData) {
                        ....
                    },
    ....
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>content</em> property allows additional key/value pairs to be sent in the query string. The
<em>timeStamp</em> parameter serves only to control <em>Amazon CloudFront</em> cache. It&#8217;s not processed server side.</p>

<p>On the server-side we have:</p>

<pre><code>    response['Cache-Control'] = 'max-age=31536000'
    response['Expires'] = (datetime.now()+timedelta(seconds=31536000)).strftime('%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT')
</code></pre>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>There were two immediate benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduced page load time. Combined with serving static files from CDN this greatly improves the user experience;</li>
<li>Reduced server load. Content is requested only once if it is missing from the cache and then served from CloudFront.
The server isn&#8217;t so busy serving content so it can be used to do more computations or simply reduce the bill.</li>
</ul>


<p>The presented method works well for <em>Difio</em> because of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The content which <em>Difio</em> serves usually doesn&#8217;t change at all once made public. In rare occasions, for example an error
has been published, we have to regenerate new content and publish it under the same URL.</li>
<li>Before content is made public it is inspected for errors and this also preseeds the cache.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2012/04/17/using-openshift-as-amazon-cloudfront-origin-server/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-17T17:30:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2012/04/17/using-openshift-as-amazon-cloudfront-origin-server</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been several months after the start of <a href="http://www.dif.io"><em>Difio</em></a> and we started
migrating various parts of the platform to CDN. The first to go are static 01 like
CSS, JavaScript, images and such. In this article I will show you how to get started with
<em>Amazon CloudFront</em> and <em>OpenShift</em>. It is very easy once you understand how it works.</p>

<h2>Why CloudFront and OpenShift</h2>

<p><em>Amazon CloudFront</em> is cheap and easy to setup with virtually no maintenance.
The most important feature 04 that it can fetch content from any public website.
Integrating it together with <em>OpenShift</em> gives some nice benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>All static assets are managed with Git and stored in the same place where the application
code and HTML is - easy to develop and deploy;</li>
<li>No need for external service to host the static files;</li>
<li><em>CloudFront</em> will be serving the files so network load on <em>OpenShift</em> is minimal;</li>
<li>Easy to manage versioned URLs because HTML and static assets are in the same repo - more on this later;</li>
</ul>


<h2>Object expiration</h2>

<p><em>CloudFront</em> will cache your objects for a certain period and then expire them. Frequently
used objects are expired less often. Depending on the content you may want to update the cache
more or less frequently. In my case CSS and JavaScript files change rarely so I wanted to tell
CloudFront to not expire the files quickly. I did this by telling <em>Apache</em> to send a custom value for
the Expires header.</p>

<pre><code>    $ curl http://d71ktrt2emu2j.cloudfront.net/static/v1/css/style.css -D headers.txt
    $ cat headers.txt 
    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    Date: Mon, 16 Apr 2012 19:02:16 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.2.15 (Red Hat)
    Last-Modified: Mon, 16 Apr 2012 19:00:33 GMT
    ETag: "120577-1b2d-4bdd06fc6f640"
    Accept-Ranges: bytes
    Content-Length: 6957
    Cache-Control: max-age=31536000
    Expires: Tue, 16 Apr 2013 19:02:16 GMT
    Content-Type: text/css
    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000, includeSubDomains
    Age: 73090
    X-Cache: Hit from cloudfront
    X-Amz-Cf-Id: X558vcEOsQkVQn5V9fbrWNTdo543v8VStxdb7LXIcUWAIbLKuIvp-w==,e8Dipk5FSNej3e0Y7c5ro-9mmn7OK8kWfbaRGwi1ww8ihwVzSab24A==
    Via: 1.0 d6343f267c91f2f0e78ef0a7d0b7921d.cloudfront.net (CloudFront)
    Connection: close
</code></pre>

<p>All headers before Strict-Transport-Security come from the origin server.</p>

<h2>Versioning</h2>

<p>Sometimes however you need to update the files and force <em>CloudFront</em> to update the content.
The recommended way to do this is to use URL versioning and update the path to the files
which changed. This will force <em>CloudFront</em> to cache and serve the content under the new path
while keeping the old content available until it expires. This way your visitors will not be
viewing your site with the new CSS and old JavaScript.</p>

<p>There are many ways to do this and there are some nice frameworks as well. For Python there is <em>webassets</em>.
I don&#8217;t have many static files so I opted for no additional dependencies. Instead I will be updating the
versions by hand.</p>

<p>What comes to mind is using <em>mod_rewrite</em> to redirect the versioned URLs back to non versioned ones.
However there&#8217;s a catch. If you do this <em>CloudFront</em> will cache the redirect itself, not the content.
The next time visitors hit <em>CloudFront</em> they will receive the cached redirect and follow it back to your
origin server, which is defeating the purpose of having CDN.</p>

<p>To do it properly you have to rewrite the URLs but still return a 200 response code and the
content which needs to be cached. This is done with <em>mod_proxy</em>:</p>

<pre><code>    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule ^VERSION-(\d+)/(.*)$ http://%{ENV:OPENSHIFT_INTERNAL_IP}:%{ENV:OPENSHIFT_INTERNAL_PORT}/static/$2 [P,L]
</code></pre>

<p>This .htaccess trick doesn&#8217;t work on <em>OpenShift</em> though. <em>mod_proxy</em> is not enabled at the moment.
See <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=812389">bug 812389</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Luckily I was able to use symlinks to point to the content. Here&#8217;s how it looks:</p>

<pre><code>    $ pwd
    /home/atodorov/difio/wsgi/static

    $ cat .htaccess
    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"

    $ ls -l
    drwxrwxr-x. 6 atodorov atodorov 4096 16 Apr 21,31 o
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 atodorov atodorov    1 16 Apr 21,47 v1 -&gt; o

    settings.py:
    STATIC_URL = '//d71ktrt2emu2j.cloudfront.net/static/v1/'

    HTML template:
    &lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}css/style.css" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>How to implement it</h2>

<p>First you need to split all CSS and JavaScript from your HTML if you haven&#8217;t done so already.</p>

<p>Then place everything under your git repo so that <em>OpenShift</em> will serve the files. For Python applications
place the files under wsgi/static/ directory in your git repo.</p>

<p>Point all of your HTML templates to the static location on <em>OpenShift</em> and test if everything works as expected.
This is best done if you&#8217;re using some sort of template language and store the location
in a single variable which you can change later.
<em>Difio</em> uses <em>Django</em> and the <em>STATIC_URL</em> variable of course.</p>

<p>Create your <em>CloudFront</em> distribution - don&#8217;t use <em>Amazon S3</em>, instead configure a custom origin server. Write down
your <em>CloudFront</em> URL. It will be something like <strong>1234xyz.cludfront.net</strong>.</p>

<p>Every time a request hits <em>CloudFront</em> it will check if the object is present in the cache. If not present
<em>CloudFront</em> will fetch the object from the origin server and populate the cache. Then the object is sent
to the user.</p>

<p>Update your templates to point to the new cloudfront.net URL and redeploy your website!</p>

    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2012/03/14/openshift-cron-takes-over-celerybeat/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-14T20:48:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2012/03/14/openshift-cron-takes-over-celerybeat</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://celeryproject.org/"><em>Celery</em></a> is an asynchronous task queue/job queue
based on distributed message passing. You can define tasks as Python functions,
execute them in the background and in a periodic fashion.
<a href="http://www.dif.io"><em>Difio</em></a> uses <em>Celery</em> for virtually everything.
Some of the tasks are scheduled after some event takes place (like user pressed a button)
or scheduled periodically.</p>

<p><em>Celery</em> provides several components of which <em>celerybeat</em> is the periodic task scheduler.
When combined with <a href="http://djangoproject.com"><em>Django</em></a> it gives you a very nice admin interface
which allows periodic tasks to be added to the scheduler.</p>

<h2>Why change</h2>

<p><em>Difio</em> has relied on <em>celerybeat</em> for a couple of months. Back then, when <em>Difio</em> launched,
there was no cron support for OpenShift so running <em>celerybeat</em> sounded reasonable.
It used to run on a dedicated virtual server and for most of the time that was fine.</p>

<p>There were a number of issues which <em>Difio</em> faced during its first months:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>celerybeat</em> would sometime die due to no free memory on the virtual instance.
When that happened no new tasks were scheduled and data was left unprocessed.
Let alone that higher memory instance and the processing power which comes with it
cost extra money.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Difio</em> is split into several components which need to have the same code base
locally - the most important are database settings and the periodic tasks
code. At least in one occasion <em>celerybeat</em> failed to start because of a buggy
task code. The offending code was fixed in the application server on OpenShift but
not properly synced to the <em>celerybeat</em> instance. Keeping code in sync is a priority
for distributed projects which rely on <em>Celery</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Celery</em> and <em>django-celery</em> seem to be updated quite often. This poses a significant risk
of ending up with different versions on the scheduler, worker nodes and the app server. This will
bring the whole application to a halt if at some point a backward incompatible change is introduced
and not properly tested and updated. Keeping infrastructure components in sync can be a big challenge
and I try to minimize this effort as much as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Having to navigate to the admin pages every time I add a new task or want to change the execution
frequency doesn&#8217;t feel very natural for a console user like myself and IMHO is less productive.
For the record I primarily use <em>mcedit</em>. I wanted to have something more close to the
write, commit and push work-flow.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The take over</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s been some time since OpenShift
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/openshift/community/blogs/getting-started-with-cron-jobs-on-openshift">introduced</a>
the cron cartridge and I decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>The first thing I did is to write a simple script which can execute any task from the difio.tasks module
by piping it to the Django shell (a Python shell actually).</p>

<pre><code>$ cat run_celery_task 

#!/bin/bash
#
# Copyright (c) 2012, Alexander Todorov &lt;atodorov@nospam.otb.bg&gt;
#
# This script is symlinked to from the hourly/minutely, etc. directories
#
# SYNOPSIS
#
# ./run_celery_task cron_search_dates
#
# OR
#
# ln -s run_celery_task cron_search_dates
# ./cron_search_dates
#

TASK_NAME=$1
[ -z "$TASK_NAME" ] &amp;&amp; TASK_NAME=$(basename $0)

if [ -n "$OPENSHIFT_APP_DIR" ]; then
    source $OPENSHIFT_APP_DIR/virtenv/bin/activate
    export PYTHON_EGG_CACHE=$OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/.python-eggs
    REPO_DIR=$OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR
else
    REPO_DIR=$(dirname $0)"/../../.."
fi

echo "import difio.tasks; difio.tasks.$TASK_NAME.delay()" | $REPO_DIR/wsgi/difio/manage.py shell
</code></pre>

<p>This is a multicall script which allows symlinks with different names to point to it.
Thus to add a new task to cron I just need to make a symlink to the script from one of the
hourly, minutely, daily, etc. directories under cron/</p>

<p>The script accepts a parameter as well which allows me to execute it locally for debugging purposes
or to schedule some tasks out of band.</p>

<p>This is how it looks like on the file system:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l .openshift/cron/hourly/
some_task_name -&gt; ../tasks/run_celery_task
another_task -&gt; ../tasks/run_celery_task
</code></pre>

<p>After having done these preparations I only had to embed the cron cartridge and git push to OpenShift:</p>

<pre><code>rhc-ctl-app -a difio -e add-cron-1.4 &amp;&amp; git push
</code></pre>

<h2>What&#8217;s next</h2>

<p>At present OpenShift can schedule your jobs every minute, hour, day, week or month and does so using the
<em>run-parts</em> script. You can&#8217;t schedule a script to execute at 4:30 every Monday or every 45 minutes for example.
See <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=803485">rhbz #803485</a> if you want to follow the
progress. Luckily <em>Difio</em> doesn&#8217;t use this sort of job scheduling for the moment.</p>

<p><em>Difio</em> is scheduling periodic tasks from OpenShift cron for a few days already.
It seems to work reliably and with no issues. One less component to maintain and worry about.
More time to write code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to examine the Perl environment on OpenShift and got tired of making snapshots,
unzipping the archive and poking through the files. I wanted a shell. Here&#8217;s how to get one.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get the application info first</p>

<pre><code> $ rhc-domain-info

     Welcome to OpenShift shell

     This shell will assist you in managing OpenShift applications.

     !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!!
     Shell access is quite powerful and it is possible for you to
     accidentally damage your application.  Proceed with care!
     If worse comes to worst, destroy your application with 'rhc app destroy'
     and recreate it
     !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!!

     Type "help" for more info.

 [myapp-mydomain.rhcloud.com ~]\&gt;

    <updated>2012-02-18T01:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2012/02/18/how-to-update-dependencies-on-openshift</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are already running some cool application on <a href="http://openshift.redhat.com">OpenShift</a>
it could be the case that you have to update some of the packages installed as dependencies.
Here is an example for an application using the python-2.6 cartridge.</p>

<h2>Pull latest upstream packages</h2>

<p>The most simple method is to update everything to the latest upstream versions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Backup! Backup! Backup!</p>

<pre><code> rhc-snapshot -a mycoolapp
 mv mycoolapp.tar.gz mycoolapp-backup-before-update.tar.gz
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you haven&#8217;t specified any particular version in <code>setup.py</code> it will
look like this:</p>

<pre><code>  ...
  install_requires=[
                  'difio-openshift-python',
                  'MySQL-python',
                  'Markdown',
                 ],
  ...
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To update simply push to OpenShift instructing it to rebuild your virtualenv:</p>

<pre><code> cd mycoolapp/
 touch .openshift/markers/force_clean_build
 git add .openshift/markers/force_clean_build
 git commit -m "update to latest upstream"
 git push
</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<p>Voila! The environment hosting your application is rebuilt from scratch.</p>

<h2>Keeping some packages unchanged</h2>

<p>Suppose that before the update you have <code>Markdown-2.0.1</code> and you want to keep it!
This is easily solved by adding versioned dependency to <code>setup.py</code></p>

<pre><code>    -       'Markdown',
    +       'Markdown==2.0.1',
</code></pre>

<p>If you do that OpenShift will install the same <code>Markdown</code> version when rebuilding your
application. Everything else will use the latest available versions.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> after the update it&#8217;s recommended that you remove the
<code>.openshift/markers/force_clean_build</code> file. This will speed up the push/build process
and will not surprise you with unwanted changes.</p>

<h2>Update only selected packages</h2>

<p>Unless your application is really simple or you have tested the updates, I suspect that
you want to update only selected packages. This can be done without rebuilding the whole
virtualenv. Use versioned dependencies in <code>setup.py</code> :</p>

<pre><code>    -       'Markdown==2.0.1',
    -       'django-countries',
    +       'Markdown&gt;=2.1',
    +       'django-countries&gt;=1.1.2',
</code></pre>

<p>No need for <code>force_clean_build</code> this time. Just</p>

<pre><code>    git commit &amp;&amp; git push
</code></pre>

<p>At the time of writing my application was using <code>Markdown-2.0.1</code> and <code>django-countries-1.0.5</code>.
Then it updated to <code>Markdown-2.1.1</code> and <code>django-countires-1.1.2</code> which also happened to be
the latest versions.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> this will not work without <code>force_clean_build</code></p>

<pre><code>    -       'django-countries==1.0.5',
    +       'django-countries',
</code></pre>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<p>OpenShift uses a local mirror of <a href="http://pypi.python.org">Python Package Index</a>.
It seems to be updated every 24 hours or so. Have this in mind if you want to update
to a package that was just released. It will not work!</p>
