    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2013/05/07/difio-add-on-tests-available</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce the general
availability of <a href="http://www.dif.io/add-on/">add-on tests</a> which are
designed to test and verify potential issues or
known bugs. Add-on tests are provided as a
<a href="https://difio-otb.rhcloud.com/profiles/mine/">subscription service</a>
for 10 $ per month. First month is free.</p>

<h2>What add-on tests are available</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>API diff</strong> - Difio generates API definition from the package
source code. Changes in API could be
backward incompatible and result in application crash and runtime failures.
API diff is currently available for <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Java</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Full diff</strong> - this is the full git diff between two package versions.
It is available for informational purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Package Size Change</strong> - packages that change their size significantly
can be a sign of
a <a href="https://github.com/tschellenbach/Django-facebook/issues/262">corrupted build</a>.
This test reports any size changes over 30%.
See <a href="http://www.dif.io/updates/django-facebook-4.2.11/django-facebook-4.3.0/12243/">DIFIO-12243</a> for example.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>File Size Change</strong> - inspects files which are present in both versions.
Any size change that is both more than 20% and more than 20 KB or
any file that changes from being zero-sized to non-zero sized, and vice-versa is reported.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Added non-text Files</strong> - new files are classified with libmagic.
Any non-text file is reported.
Bugs like <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/19858">Django #19858</a> can
be found with this test. For example see <a href="http://www.dif.io/updates/Django-1.4.3/Django-1.4.4/12987/">DIFIO-12987</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modified Files</strong> - lists all modified files. You should manually review the
list and inspect if unwanted files were modified.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Added Files</strong> - lists all newly added files. New files are usually resources, tests of new
functionality. Manually inspect to verify additions are expected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Removed Files</strong> - files in packages should be removed only if properly obsoleted or
initial inclusion was a bug. Removing modules or parts of them can break the API.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Renamed Files</strong> - renaming files can break API. This test lists all renames
between two versions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Permissions Change</strong> - file permissions change (Linux/UNIX only) could indicate
security issues. In a source package without executable programs permissions should
not change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symlinks</strong> - this test traverses the entire package tree and reports any symlinks found.
It will report FAIL if any symlinks exist in the new package.
For example see <a href="http://www.dif.io/updates/factory_boy-1.2.0/factory_boy-2.0.0/16005/">DIFIO-16005</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>File Types Change</strong> - this test compares file types reported by libmagic between
two package versions. Files should not be changing their type between updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Virus Scan</strong> - a virus scan is performed on the package using the ClamAV virus scanner.
Even though it is unlikely that packages contain viruses, it&#8217;s still important to know if anti
virus tools will trigger false positives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Test Cases</strong> - this test reports any changes in test cases. It counts the number of available
test case files in some well known locations. If new version is missing tests or has less
then severity will be VERIFY or FAIL.</p></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce API diff support
for Java and PHP programming languages.</p>

<p>The API diff feature extracts class and method signatures and compares the
results between an older and a newer version. If API has changed this
is a good indicator that there were substantial changes in the new package
version, which require through testing.</p>

<p>With this release API diff becomes available for source code written in
Java, PHP and Python. We are looking to support other languages as well.</p>

    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2013/03/06/improved-support-for-php/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-06T11:05:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2013/03/06/improved-support-for-php</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce improved support
for the PHP programming language and the
<a href="http://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> dependency management tool.</p>

<p>Previously only PHP PEAR packages were supported and it was not possible
to manually import a list of packages. Starting today, these issues have been
fixed.</p>

<p>At the moment Difio supports three upstream sources for PHP packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://packagist.org/">https://packagist.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pear.php.net/">http://pear.php.net/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pear2.php.net/">http://pear2.php.net/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Users are now able to manually import package list from their PHP applications
using Composer.</p>

<p>To register PHP apps go to
<a href="https://difio-otb.rhcloud.com/application/import/composer-show/?">https://difio-otb.rhcloud.com/application/import/composer-show/?</a>
and paste the output of <code>php composer.phar show --installed</code> command.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./composer.phar show --installed
doctrine/common                              2.3.0   Common Library for Doctrine projects
imagine/Imagine                              v0.4.1  Image processing for PHP 5.3
pear-pear.php.net/HTTP_Request2              2.1.1   PHP5 rewrite of HTTP_Request package ...
pear-pear.php.net/XML_Util                   1.2.1   Selection of methods that are often needed when working with XML documents ...
pear-pear2.php.net/PEAR2_Cache_SHM           0.1.0   Allows you to share data across requests as long as the PHP process is running. ...
pear-pear2.php.net/PEAR2_Text_Markdown       0.1.0   This is a port of Solar_Markdown.
psr/log                                      1.0.0   Common interface for logging libraries
symfony/symfony                              v2.2.0  The Symfony PHP framework
twig/twig                                    v1.12.2 Twig, the flexible, fast, and secure template language for PHP
</code></pre>

<p>This application contains packages from the three different sources and they
will be properly parsed and recognized by Difio.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s next</h2>

<p>Difio is constantly working on improving the service. We are now looking into
API diff support for PHP among other things, so stay tuned!

    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2013/02/25/new-dashboard-and-follow-packages/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-25T11:55:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2013/02/25/new-dashboard-and-follow-packages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce our new dashboard
and the ability to follow packages without registering applications. Read
below for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Latest Releases</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/new_dashboard/releases.png" title="Latest Releases" alt="Latest Releases" /></p>

<p>The default dashboard page is showing a news stream of all latest releases
for packages the user is following or using inside applications.</p>

<p><strong>Change History</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/new_dashboard/change_history.png" title="Change History" alt="Change History" /></p>

<p>This page is showing a news stream of change analysis between multiple package
versions that the user is following or using inside applications. As shown in this
example the user is following <code>bundler-1.2.1</code> and <code>bundler-1.2.3</code> while the latest
available is <code>bundler-1.3.0</code> and <code>bundler-1.2.5</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Follow Packages</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/new_dashboard/follow.png" title="Follow Packages" alt="Follow Packages" /></p>

<p>A new page to view and search packages is now available. Users can follow or unfollow
any packages and versions they want through the buttons. Simple color codes
distinguish between different states: green - user is following version;
gray - version is used inside registered application; transparent - not following version.
Versions which are used inside applications can only be removed/unfollowed by deleting
the entire application, or deleting the package from the application.
For example <code>Pygments-1.5</code> is been used in an application, but <code>Pygments-1.6</code> is been
followed manually.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended to follow a particular version, not only the package name.
If a user decides to follow only package name, but not versions, Difio will not be
able to generate change analysis reports because there&#8217;s no
basis to compare to. In this case the user will be able to see only the latest
releases news stream.</p>

<p><strong>Applications</strong></p>

<p>This page is showing all registered applications for which Difio is monitoring dependencies.
This page has been available previously and also includes the improvements
<a href="http://dif.io/blog/blog/2013/02/21/new-look-feel-application-info-pages/">announced last week</a>.
Small speed improvements have been made to this page as well.</p>

<p><strong>Invite Friends</strong></p>

<p>This is an interactive dialog which allows you to invite your fellows to try Difio.
It only asks for the email addresses of your friends and sends them an invitation.
We do not keep track of these addresses nor send any spam to them.</p>

<hr />

<p>We encourage developers from all supported backgrounds and
languages to <a href="https://difio-otb.rhcloud.com/dashboard/follow/">start following packages</a>
and send us their feedback via <a href="https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new">GitHub</a>

    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2013/02/21/new-look-feel-application-info-pages/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-21T00:42:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2013/02/21/new-look-feel-application-info-pages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce new look and feel
for application info pages. Difio keeps track of application
dependencies and tells you when they change. We let you inspect the
changes and make informed decision when or what to upgrade.</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/new_app_info.png" title="App Info page" alt="App Info Page" /></p>

<p>Previously the application info page was showing only the latest available
updates. This made it hard for users to inspect older updates.
For example if you had Django-1.4.3 you would see the
latest Django-1.4.5 but not 1.4.4.</p>

<p>For packages which maintain several active branches it was not possible to
compare installed version against stable branch versions. It was always compared
to the latest from the master branch.
For example if you had ffi-1.3.0 you could not see ffi-1.3.1 but
would see ffi-1.4.0 instead.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s release fixes this by offering the user all available updates to
their packages. In addition change rate icons are replaced by color codes.
The version string is now shown as a button in one of the standard colors
green (low), orange (medium) or red (high). Improvement has been made to
the page load speed as well. It is now significantly faster.</p>

<p>Email notifications still display only the highest available version.
This will be changed soon to include intermediate versions.
At the moment information about intermediate versions is available only
via the web interface or <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/difio/updates">RSS</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage developers from all backgrounds and
languages to <a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">register</a> their applications and
send us their feedback via <a href="https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new">GitHub</a>

    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2013/01/24/graphical-or-tabular-view-you-vote-we-code/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-24T14:43:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2013/01/24/graphical-or-tabular-view-you-vote-we-code</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello guys! We haven&#8217;t posted in a while and we&#8217;re sorry for this. Here&#8217;s an idea which is
going around in our heads. Let us know what do you think.</p>

<h2>Tabular View</h2>

<p>Currently when you log into the <a href="https://difio-otb.rhcloud.com/applications/mine/">application dashboard</a>
and navigate to the details view of each application you see this:</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/appdetails.png" title="Tabular view" alt="Tabular view" /></p>

<p>The installed packages are on the left while new versions are on the right. The links point to
more detailed information about changes between the two versions. By default only the
available updates are shown but you can display all installed packages as well.</p>

<p>We also have a history page which holds a snapshot of your installed dependencies
whenever they change. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/history_records.png" title="History records" alt="History records" /></p>

<p>These two pages inform you about the latest and greatest versions
and which ones you have been using in the past. However they don&#8217;t show you
any version release history nor how does your application relate to that.</p>

<h2>Graphical View</h2>

<p>Our proposal is to implement a graphical view as shown on the mock-up below:</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/app_graph.png" title="Graphical view" alt="Graphical view" /></p>

<p>On the vertical axis are all the dependencies used by your application. By default only outdated
ones are shown, sorted by their name for readability.</p>

<p>On the horizontal axis are all available versions for that particular package shown as markers.
A tooltip shows you the package name and version. Density and scale is based on release dates.
Zoom will help you investigate more closely.</p>

<p>The marker or the tooltip can be a link to the standard page where these two versions are compared and analyzed.
The marker icon can be left as is or be one of the icons representing Low, Medium or High change rate.</p>

<p>Individual packages can be turned on or off of course.</p>

<p>Application state is shown as a line connecting the versions you have installed. Previous states, where dependency
versions were different can be represented as similar lines on the left. The leftmost being the oldest history record.
State lines can also be turned on or off if the view gets too crowded.</p>

<h2>You Vote, We Code</h2>

<p>The ball is yours now! If this page gets over 50 tweets, comments, shares or likes we are going to implement this in <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a>.
A breakdown of features will be posted in the comments below. Please vote up or down for any of them.
Features that get promoted will be implemented.</p>

<p>If you have any other ideas or suggestions please let us know. You can use the comments form or submit them
via <a href="https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/DifioNews">Twitter</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2012/11/27/difio-adds-application-history-tracking/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-27T23:04:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2012/11/27/difio-adds-application-history-tracking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce
support for tracking application history. Difio keeps track of application
dependencies and tells you when they change. We let you inspect the
changes and make informed decision when or what to upgrade.</p>

<p>Our team has added a new feature to track changes in the list of
dependencies used by applications. Every time you upgrade, add or remove a
package from your application dependencies Difio creates a history record.
As always, don&#8217;t forget to re-run the registration script or to manually refresh
your apps after changing the dependencies!</p>

<p>Every application starts with a single history record, reflecting its latest state.
Later you can review your app history and revert to previously used versions
for example. Difio is planning to add more goodies to the history page in a future
release. If you have an idea and want us to implement it, please post it on the
<a href="http://www.dif.io/#ideas">ideas dashboard</a>!</p>

<p>This new functionality is accessible on the application details view via the
<em>Last check-in</em> hyperlink, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/apphistory.png" title="Link to history page" alt="Link to history page" /></p>

    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2012/11/14/difio-1.9-release-announcement/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-14T10:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2012/11/14/difio-1.9-release-announcement</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce version 1.9
of our dependencies monitoring service. Difio keeps track of application
dependencies and tells you when they change. We let you inspect the
changes and make informed decision when or what to upgrade.</p>

<p>This release includes several new features and website updates.</p>

<h2>API diff</h2>

<p>The <em>API diff</em> feature is exploring packages source code and builds their
API definitions. Then definitions between your currently installed package
and the latest upstream version are compared. Changes are presented as a
colored diff format for better readability.</p>

<p><em>API diff</em> is accessible through the main update view, next to changelog,
commit log and bugs list as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/api_diff.png" title="API diff example" alt="API diff example" /></p>

<p><em>API diff</em> is initially available only for Python. For Python we support
detection of class definitions, function definitions and decorators.</p>

<p>Example showing no API changes can be seen with a recent
<a href="http://www.dif.io/updates/MySQL-python-1.2.4b5/MySQL-python-1.2.4c1/8439/">MySQL-python release</a>.</p>

<p>Example showing new classes being added and some functions changing can be
seen with a recent
<a href="http://www.dif.io/updates/django-social-auth-0.7.7/django-social-auth-0.7.9/8791/">django-social-auth release</a>.</p>

<p><em>API diff</em> support for other languages will be added in future releases!</p>

<h2>Refresh manually imported apps</h2>

<p>It is now possible to refresh the dependency list for manually imported applications.
Simply click the <em>Refresh</em> button as shown below and import the dependency list again.</p>

<p><img src="http://dif.io/blog/images/refresh_app.png" title="Refresh button" alt="Refresh button" /></p>

<p>The refresh functionality has always been present for all of our PaaS
<a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">registration agents</a>.</p>

<h2>Share the package list</h2>

<p>When you need to match your dev environment with the production one, or
ensure dependency similarity between multiple nodes you need the
list of already installed packages.</p>

<p>In this release Difio adds a new button labeled <em>Package List</em> which exports
all installed dependencies as plain text. The format is name==version.
You can share this list with other developers as needed.</p>

<h2>Minor improvements and bug fixes</h2>

<p>We have also done lots of minor improvements and fixes to our website.
They are invisible to the naked eye so no need to tell you more :).</p>

<p>We encourage developers from all backgrounds and languages to <a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">register</a>
their applications and send us their feedback via <a href="https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new">GitHub</a>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.dif.io">Difio</a> is pleased to announce initial
support for <a href="http://cloudcontrol.com">cloudControl</a>. Difio provides insight of available
updates for open source components. It lets you inspect changes and take
informed decision when or what to upgrade. This improves software life cycle
planning and minimizes possible regressions and downtime.</p>

<p>We have added two new registration scripts allowing <em>cloudControl</em> developers to
subscribe their applications to Difio. At the moment there is support for
<a href="https://github.com/difio/difio-cloudcontrol-python/blob/master/README.rst">Python</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/difio/difio-cloudcontrol-ruby/blob/master/README.md">Ruby</a>
programming languages. Difio is working together with <em>cloudControl</em> to add support
for Java and PHP as well, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>We encourage developers who use <em>cloudControl</em> to <a href="http://www.dif.io/register/">register</a>
their applications and send us their feedback via <a href="https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new">GitHub</a>

    <link href="http://dif.io/blog/2012/05/19/cross-domain-ajax-served-from-cdn/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-19T16:58:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://dif.io/blog/2012/05/19/cross-domain-ajax-served-from-cdn</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week Amazon <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/05/amazon-cloudfront-support-for-dynamic-content.html">announced</a>
support for dynamic content in their CDN solution <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/"><em>Amazon CloudFront</em></a>.
The announce coincided with my efforts to migrate more pieces of <em>Difio</em>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dif.io">website</a> to <em>CloudFront</em>.</p>

<p>In this article I will not talk about hosting static files on CDN. This is easy and I&#8217;ve already written
about it <a href="http://dif.io/blog/2012/04/17/using-openshift-as-amazon-cloudfront-origin-server/">here</a>. I will show how to
cache AJAX(JSONP actually) responses and serve them directly from <em>Amazon CloudFront</em>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>For those if you who may not be familiar (are there any) CDN stands for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">Content Delivery Network</a>. In short
this employs numerous servers with identical content. The requests from the browser are served
from the location which gives best performance for the user. This is used by all major websites
to speed-up static content like images, video, CSS and JavaScript files.</p>

<p>AJAX means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</a>.
This is what Google uses to create dynamic user interface which doesn&#8217;t require to reload the page.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p><em>Difio</em> has two web interfaces. The primary one is a static HTML website
which employs JavaScript for the dynamic areas. It is hosted on the dif.io domain.
The other one is powered by Django and provides the same interface plus the
<a href="https://difio-otb.rhcloud.com/applications/mine/">applications dashboard</a> and several API functions
which don&#8217;t have a visible user interface. This is under the *.rhcloud.com domain b/c it is hosted on
<a href="http://openshift.redhat.com"><em>OpenShift</em></a>.</p>

<p>The present state of the website is the result of rapid development using conventional methods -
HTML templates and server-side processing. This is migrating to modern web technology like static HTML
and JavaScript while the server side will remain pure API service.</p>

<p>For this migration to happen I need the HTML pages at dif.io to execute JavaScript and load information
which comes from the rhcloud.com domain. Unfortunately this is not easily doable with AJAX because
of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">Same origin policy</a> in browsers.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using the <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/"><em>Dojo Toolkit</em></a> JavaScript framework which has a solution.
It&#8217;s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a>. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>

<pre><code>     dif.io ------ JSONP request --&gt; abc.rhcloud.com --v
        ^                                              |
        |                                              |
    JavaScript processing                              |
        |                                              |
        +------------------ JSONP response ------------+
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty standard configuration for a web service.</p>

<h2>Going to the clouds</h2>

<p>The way <em>Dojo</em> implements JSONP is through the
<a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.7/dojo/io/script.html">dojo.io.script</a> module.
It works by appending a query string parameter of the form <em>?callback=funcName</em> which the server uses
to generate the JSONP response. This callback name is dynamically generated by <em>Dojo</em> based on the order
in which your call to <em>dojo.io.script</em> is executed.</p>

<p>Until recently <em>Amazon CloudFront</em> ignored all query string parameters when requesting the content from
the origin server. Without the query string it was not possible to generate the JSONP response.
Luckily Amazon resolved the issue only one day after I asked about it on their forums.</p>

<p>Now <em>Amazon CloudFront</em> will use the URL path and the query string parameters to identify the objects in cache.
To enable this edit the CloudFront distribution <em>behavior(s)</em> and set <em>Forward Query Strings</em> to Yes.</p>

<p>When a visitor of the website requests the data <em>Amazon CloudFront</em> will use exactly the same url path and query strings
to fetch the content from the origin server. All that I had to do is switch the domain of the JSONP service
to point to the cloudfront.net domain. It became like this:</p>

<pre><code>                                                        | Everything on this side is handled by Amazon.
                                                        | No code required!
                                                        |
     dif.io ------ JSONP request --&gt; xyz.cloudfront.net -- JSONP request if cache miss --&gt; abc.rhcloud.com --v
        ^                              |                ^                                                    |
        |                              |                |                                                    |
    JavaScript processing              |                +---------- JSONP response --------------------------+
        |                              |
        +---- cached JSONP response ---+
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the website structure and code didn&#8217;t change at all. All that changed was a single domain name.</p>

<h2>Controlling the cache</h2>

<p><em>Amazon CloudFront</em> will keep the contents in cache based on the origin headers if present or the manual configuration
from the AWS Console. To work around frequent requests to the origin server it is considered best practice to set the
Expires header to a value far in the future, like 1 year.
However if the content changes you need some way to tell <em>CloudFront</em> about it. The most commonly used method is through
using different URLs to access the same content. This will cause <em>CloudFront</em> to cache the content under the new location
while keeping the old content until it expires.</p>

<p><em>Dojo</em> makes this very easy:</p>

<pre><code>    require(["dojo/io/script"],
        function(script) {
                script.get({
                    url: "https://xyz.cloudfront.net/api/json/updates/1234",
                    callbackParamName: "callback",
                    content: {t: timeStamp},
                    load: function(jsonData) {
                        ....
                    },
    ....
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>content</em> property allows additional key/value pairs to be sent in the query string. The
<em>timeStamp</em> parameter serves only to control <em>Amazon CloudFront</em> cache. It&#8217;s not processed server side.</p>

<p>On the server-side we have:</p>

<pre><code>    response['Cache-Control'] = 'max-age=31536000'
    response['Expires'] = (datetime.now()+timedelta(seconds=31536000)).strftime('%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT')
</code></pre>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>There were two immediate benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduced page load time. Combined with serving static files from CDN this greatly improves the user experience;</li>
<li>Reduced server load. Content is requested only once if it is missing from the cache and then served from CloudFront.
The server isn&#8217;t so busy serving content so it can be used to do more computations or simply reduce the bill.</li>
</ul>


<p>The presented method works well for <em>Difio</em> because of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The content which <em>Difio</em> serves usually doesn&#8217;t change at all once made public. In rare occasions, for example an error
has been published, we have to regenerate new content and publish it under the same URL.</li>
<li>Before content is made public it is inspected for errors and this also preseeds the cache.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been several months after the start of <a href="http://www.dif.io"><em>Difio</em></a> and we started
migrating various parts of the platform to CDN. The first to go are static 01 like
CSS, JavaScript, images and such. In this article I will show you how to get started with
<em>Amazon CloudFront</em> and <em>OpenShift</em>. It is very easy once you understand how it works.</p>

<h2>Why CloudFront and OpenShift</h2>

<p><em>Amazon CloudFront</em> is cheap and easy to setup with virtually no maintenance.
The most important feature 04 that it can fetch content from any public website.
Integrating it together with <em>OpenShift</em> gives some nice benefits:</p>

<li>All static assets are managed with Git and stored in the same place where the application
code and HTML is - easy to develop and deploy;</li>
<li>No need for external service to host the static files;</li>
<li><em>CloudFront</em> will be serving the files so network load on <em>OpenShift</em> is minimal;</li>
<li>Easy to manage versioned URLs because HTML and static assets are in the same repo - more on this later;</li>

<h2>Object expiration</h2>

<p><em>CloudFront</em> will cache your objects for a certain period and then expire them. Frequently
used objects are expired less often. Depending on the content you may want to update the cache
more or less frequently. In my case CSS and JavaScript files change rarely so I wanted to tell
CloudFront to not expire the files quickly. I did this by telling <em>Apache</em> to send a custom value for
the Expires header.</p>

<pre><code>    $ curl http://d71ktrt2emu2j.cloudfront.net/static/v1/css/style.css -D headers.txt
    $ cat headers.txt

<p>All headers before Strict-Transport-Security come from the origin server.</p>

<h2>Versioning</h2>

<p>Sometimes however you need to update the files and force <em>CloudFront</em> to update the content.
The recommended way to do this is to use URL versioning and update the path to the files
which changed. This will force <em>CloudFront</em> to cache and serve the content under the new path
while keeping the old content available until it expires. This way your visitors will not be
viewing your site with the new CSS and old JavaScript.</p>

<p>There are many ways to do this and there are some nice frameworks as well. For Python there is <em>webassets</em>.
I don&#8217;t have many static files so I opted for no additional dependencies. Instead I will be updating the
versions by hand.</p>

<p>What comes to mind is using <em>mod_rewrite</em> to redirect the versioned URLs back to non versioned ones.
However there&#8217;s a catch. If you do this <em>CloudFront</em> will cache the redirect itself, not the content.
The next time visitors hit <em>CloudFront</em> they will receive the cached redirect and follow it back to your
origin server, which is defeating the purpose of having CDN.</p>

<p>To do it properly you have to rewrite the URLs but still return a 200 response code and the
content which needs to be cached. This is done with <em>mod_proxy</em>:</p>

<pre><code>    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule ^VERSION-(\d+)/(.*)$ http://%{ENV:OPENSHIFT_INTERNAL_IP}:%{ENV:OPENSHIFT_INTERNAL_PORT}/static/$2 [P,L]
</code></pre>

<p>This .htaccess trick doesn&#8217;t work on <em>OpenShift</em> though. <em>mod_proxy</em> is not enabled at the moment.
See <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=812389">bug 812389</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Luckily I was able to use symlinks to point to the content. Here&#8217;s how it looks:</p>

<pre><code>    $ pwd
    /home/atodorov/difio/wsgi/static

    $ cat .htaccess
    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"

    $ ls -l
    drwxrwxr-x. 6 atodorov atodorov 4096 16 Apr 21,31 o
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 atodorov atodorov    1 16 Apr 21,47 v1 -&gt; o

    settings.py:
    STATIC_URL = '//d71ktrt2emu2j.cloudfront.net/static/v1/'

    HTML template:
    &lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}css/style.css" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>How to implement it</h2>

<p>First you need to split all CSS and JavaScript from your HTML if you haven&#8217;t done so already.</p>

<p>Then place everything under your git repo so that <em>OpenShift</em> will serve the files. For Python applications
place the files under wsgi/static/ directory in your git repo.</p>

<p>Point all of your HTML templates to the static location on <em>OpenShift</em> and test if everything works as expected.
This is best done if you&#8217;re using some sort of template language and store the location
in a single variable which you can change later.
<em>Difio</em> uses <em>Django</em> and the <em>STATIC_URL</em> variable of course.</p>

<p>Create your <em>CloudFront</em> distribution - don&#8217;t use <em>Amazon S3</em>, instead configure a custom origin server. Write down
your <em>CloudFront</em> URL. It will be something like <strong>1234xyz.cludfront.net</strong>.</p>

<p>Every time a request hits <em>CloudFront</em> it will check if the object is present in the cache. If not present
<em>CloudFront</em> will fetch the object from the origin server and populate the cache. Then the object is sent
to the user.</p>

<p>Update your templates to point to the new cloudfront.net URL and redeploy your website!</p>
