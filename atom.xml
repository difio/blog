    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://monupco.com">Monupco</a> is aiming to support a broad range of PaaS and
cloud vendors but that takes time. If your favorite PaaS platform is not
already supported here&#8217;s how you can help.</p>

<p>The client side tool is very simple and serves only a single purpose -
to build a list of installed software and send it to the server.</p>

<p>Some general considerations first:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your code should be open source! Preferably licensed under the MIT or BSD license;</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever possible use the native programming language for the platform - if writing
a client tool for PHP PaaS use PHP, if writing for Node.JS use JavaScript, etc;</p></li>
<li><p>All client side tools are bundled as packages so that they can install natively
on the platform. For Python it is a package from PyPI, for PHP it will be a PEAR package,
etc. Develop your client as a package;</p></li>
<li><p>Naming convention for client side tools is <strong>monupco-&lt;vendor>-&lt;language></strong>. For example
<code>monupco-openshift-express-python</code>, <code>monupco-dotcloud-nodejs</code>. If you have common code,
for example the package management part, it can be split into separate module named
<strong>common-&lt;language>-monupco</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Client side tools are specific to vendor and programming language. This is because
different PaaS vendors provide the information in a different way. This makes code easier
to maintain and easier for end-users to find the proper client side tool later;</p></li>
<li><p>Vendor ID and package type ID numbers are unique. It is important to use the correct IDs.
They allow proper identification of applications and packages stored in the database.
Different types of data also require different processing. Tell us for which vendor/language
you would like to contribute a client side tool and we will reserve the IDs for you;</p></li>
<li><p>We will also setup a development server so you can safely test the application
registration/update process. Just let us know you need one.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Once you have the ID allocation and development server you can start writing some code.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your code should create the following data structure:</p>

<pre><code>  {
      'user_id'    : integer,
      'app_name'   : string,
      'app_uuid'   : string,
      'app_type'   : string,
      'app_url'    : string,
      'app_vendor' : integer,
      'pkg_type'   : integer,
      'installed'  : list of {'n' : string, 'v' : string, 't' : integer}
  }
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p>Fields are defined as follow:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>user_id - integer - the ID of the user at Monupco website. All applications registered under
the same user_id will be visible only to that user. You can view your UserID
<a href="https://monupco-otb.rhcloud.com/profiles/mine/">here</a>. It is important that this value is not
hard-coded but read from ENV variable or a text file. The user will configure the proper
value when installing the client side tool into their application;</p></li>
<li><p>app_name - string - the name of the application. This is used to identify the application in the
web interface. The value is usually available from ENV variable;</p></li>
<li><p>app_uuid - string - a unique identifier of the application on the cloud platform. Some platforms
do not provide a real UUID. In such case you may use any unique string, for example $username-$appname;</p></li>
<li><p>app_type - string - type of the application, e.g. Python, Ruby, etc. Used for visualization in the
web interface. Some cloud vendors store this in ENV variable;</p></li>
<li><p>app_url - string - the URL at which the application can be accessed including the protocol part (http://).
Should be available from ENV;</p></li>
<li><p>app_vendor - integer - the vendor ID reserved by Monupco. This is used for proper identification
of applications in the web console and for processing purposes;</p></li>
<li><p>pkg_type - integer - the package type ID reserved by Monupco. This is used to properly process
package information and find new versions and updates. If the cloud platform allows only a single
type of packages to be installed into the application then use this variable. If you can install
multiple package types (e.g. Python and Ruby) then you can set this on a per-package basis;</p></li>
<li><p>installed - a list of {&#8216;n&#8217; : string, &#8216;v&#8217; : string, &#8216;t&#8217; : integer} elements, where:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>n - string - package name as identified by a native package management tool (e.g. gem, pip, etc);</p></li>
<li><p>v - string - package version;</p></li>
<li><p>t - integer (optional) - package type ID reserved by Monupco. Define it here is multiple
package types are allowed and the current package is different from <code>pkg_type</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In some cloud platforms your application will be considered as a package and listed in the database
as well. You may use an ENV variable to ignore this name and not include it in the list;</p></li>
<li><p>The defined structure is converted into JSON format and URL escaped;</p></li>
<li><p>Assign the escaped JSON string to the <code>json_data</code> POST variable;</p></li>
<li><p>Send a POST request to https://$devel-server-url/application/register/;</p></li>
<li><p>If everything went fine you will receive a 200 status code and response in JSON format:</p>

<pre><code>  {
      'message' : string,
      'exit_code' : integer
  }
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>message - holds any pass/fail messages;</p></li>
<li><p>exit_code - non 0 in case of failure.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Add a README file with instructions how to install. Pay attention to end-user configuration
settings and proper execution of the tool. The best place to place a call to
the client side tool is a post_deploy/post_install hook. Some cloud platforms do not offer
hooks. In this case you may want to ping us for some help.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Congratulations! You have just written a client side tool for your favorite PaaS and
programming language. Sent us the code for review and we will add it to our GitHub channel.</p>

    <id>http://monupco.com/blog/2012/02/10/spinning-up-a-development-instance-on-openshift-express</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://monupco.com">Monupco</a> is hosted on <a href="http://openshift.redhat.com">OpenShift</a> Express.
During development we often need to spin-up another copy of Monupco to use for testing and development.
With OpenShift this is easy and fast. Here&#8217;s how:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create another application on OpenShift. This will be your development instance.</p>

<pre><code> rhc-create-app -a myappdevel -t python-2.6
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Find out the git URL for the production application:</p>

<pre><code> $ rhc-user-info
 Application Info
 ================
 myapp
     Framework: python-2.6
      Creation: 2012-02-10T12:39:53-05:00
          UUID: 723f0331e17041e8b34228f87a6cf1f5
       Git URL: ssh://723f0331e17041e8b34228f87a6cf1f5@myapp-mydomain.rhcloud.com/~/git/myapp.git/
    Public URL: http://myapp-mydomain.rhcloud.com/
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Push the current code base from the production instance to devel instance:</p>

<pre><code> cd myappdevel
 git remote add production -m master ssh://723f0331e17041e8b34228f87a6cf1f5@myapp-mydomain.rhcloud.com/~/git/myapp.git/
 git pull -s recursive -X theirs production master
 git push
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now your <code>myappdevel</code> is the same as your production instance. You will probably want to
modify your database connection settings at this point and start adding new features.</p></li>
</ol>

    <updated>2012-02-09T18:48:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://monupco.com/blog/2012/02/09/monupco-on-openshift-express</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://monupco.com">Monupco</a> stands for Monitor Updates In The Cloud.
As the name suggests this is a service which provides updates information
for applications hosted in a PaaS environment. If you are a developer or
a sysadmin knowing when and what to upgrade will make your life easier.</p>

<p>Monupco will generate a human friendly description of changes between the
installed package version and the latest one. Currently a <a href="https://github.com/monupco/monupco-openshift-express-python">client
side tool</a> for
Python applications on OpenShift Express is available and
others will follow soon.</p>

<p>Monupco started with a local SQLite database which was the fastest way to get up
and running. At present the database layer is powered by MySQL and the intention
is to switch to NoSQL at some point. It is written in Python.</p>

<p>Monupco is split into several parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Management console - the interface with which users interact.
It is hosted on <a href="http://openshift.redhat.com/">OpenShift</a> Express.</li>
<li>Website - static HTML website which is periodically updated by a
<a href="http://celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> task.</li>
<li>Blog - powered by <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. Together with
the website this is hosted on GitHub.</li>
</ul>


<p>All source code of Monupco is managed with git and &#8216;git push&#8217; is simply a
rock star. Combining git + ssh keys made it possible to programatically commit
and push when necessary.</p>

<p>The application uses Markdown extensively. All blog and website pages
and multi-line text entries into the database are rendered as Markdown.
This makes entering and editing text very easy.</p>

<p>While developing Monupco I didn&#8217;t want to force users to remember yet another
username and password nor store them into the database. The solution is no passwords required!
Instead Monupco uses popular social networks credentials and limits the information
stored in database to the bare minimum.</p>

<p>Monupco has recently <a href="http://monupco.com/blog/2012/02/06/monupco-1.1-release-announcement/">announced</a>
its first Alpha release. The following weeks will see development for Ruby, PHP and Perl packages
and the corresponding client side tools for these catridges on OpenShift.
Java and Node.js are also under investigation.</p>

<p>Once these popular languages and package types are supported, client side tools
for other PaaS vendors will follow. On the radar are requests for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heroku</li>
<li>Engine Yard</li>
<li>AppFog</li>
<li>Google Apps Engine</li>
<li>SalesForce</li>
<li>DotCloud</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://github.com/monupco">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://monupco-otb.rhcloud.com/applications/mine/">get started</a> today!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://monupco.com">Monupco</a> is pleased to announce the general availability
of our updates monitoring service. Monupco provides user friendly interface to
monitor available updates for your cloud applications and information about different
package versions.</p>

<p>This is an alpha release for early adopters. Currently we support registration of
Python applications hosted on Red Hat&#8217;s <a href="http://openshift.redhat.com">OpenShift Express</a>
platform. Client side tools and installation information can be found at our
<a href="https://github.com/monupco/monupco-openshift-express-python">GitHub page</a>.</p>

<p>Monupco itself is developed in the cloud, for the cloud. We&#8217;re working to support
additional cloud vendors and more programming languages. Your feedback is valuable to us!
We welcome your feature requests on <a href="http://twitter.com/monupco">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/monupco/monupco.github.com/issues/new">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Monupco will remain free of charge until it reaches production-ready quality, when
subscription plans will be announced. A gratis period and/or bonus credits will be made
available to all early birds at that time.</p>

<p>We provide simplified registration and log in into our management console using
credentials from popular social networking providers.</p>
