Today [Difio](http://www.dif.io) is pleased to announce version 1.7
of our updates monitoring service. Difio provides insight of available
updates for open source components. It lets you inspect changes and take
informed decision when or what to upgrade. This improves software life cycle
planning and minimizes possible regressions and downtime.

This release adds support for Java! Available immediately is support for Java packages
from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org). We provide manual import capability as
well as registration script for [OpenShift](http://openshift.redhat.com) JBoss cartridges.
See [how to register applications](http://www.dif.io/register/) page for more information.

We encourage developers from all backgrounds and languages to [register](http://www.dif.io/register/)
their applications and send us their feedback via [GitHub](https://github.com/difio/difio/issues/new)
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DifioNews).
