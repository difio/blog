Today [Monupco](http://www.monupco.com) is pleased to announce version 1.3
of our updates monitoring service. Monupco provides user friendly interface to
monitor available updates for your cloud applications and information about different
package versions.

This release adds support for Perl packages from [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/).
Request Tracker issue tracking systems on <http://rt.cpan.org> and <http://rt.perl.org>
are also supported.

Perl support comes with registration agents for [dotCloud](http://dotcloud.com) and
[OpenShift](http://openshift.redhat.com). See the
[how to register applications](http://www.monupco.com/register/) page for more information.


Our web interface faced some changes too:

* Details about changes is no longer processed as Markdown. It is presented as
pre-formatted plain text. This is to prevent some characters (like underscores) getting
lost due to Markdown conversion;
* Update pages now integrate with [Disqus](http://disqus.com). You can use the comments form
to provide general feedback and comments and to alert our team in case the information
is incorrect.


Monupco has already produced detailed information for 950+ [updates](https://monupco-otb.rhcloud.com/updates/).
