Today [Difio](http://www.dif.io) is pleased to announce version 1.8
of our updates monitoring service. Difio provides insight of available
updates for open source components. It lets you inspect changes and take
informed decision when or what to upgrade. This improves software life cycle
planning and minimizes possible regressions and downtime.

This release changes our email notification subsystem. Users are now able to
select between daily and weekly notification. Daily digest is the default value.
If you want to change it, please login to your
[profile](https://difio-otb.rhcloud.com/profiles/mine/).
Email format has also changed. Messages now list URLs for all updates
released since the last notification which are relevant to your applications.


We encourage developers from all backgrounds and languages to [register](http://www.dif.io/register/)
their applications and send us their feedback via [GitHub](https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new)
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DifioNews).
