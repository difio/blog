Today [Difio](http://www.dif.io) is pleased to announce initial
support for [Heroku](http://heroku.com). Difio provides insight of available
updates for open source components. It lets you inspect changes and take
informed decision when or what to upgrade. This improves software life cycle
planning and minimizes possible regressions and downtime.

We have added three new registration scripts allowing *Heroku* users to
subscribe their applications to Difio. At the moment there is support for
[Python](https://github.com/difio/difio-heroku-python/blob/master/README.rst),
[Ruby](https://github.com/difio/difio-heroku-ruby/blob/master/README.md) and
[Node.js](https://github.com/difio/difio-heroku-nodejs/blob/master/README.md)
programming languages. Previously *Heroku* applications could be registered only
manually but now this is automated and more convenient.


We encourage developers who use *Heroku* to [register](http://www.dif.io/register/)
their applications and send us their feedback via [GitHub](https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new)
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DifioNews).
