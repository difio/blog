Today [Difio](http://www.dif.io) is pleased to announce 
support for tracking application history. Difio keeps track of application
dependencies and tells you when they change. We let you inspect the
changes and make informed decision when or what to upgrade.


Our team has added a new feature to track changes in the list of
dependencies used by applications. Every time you upgrade, add or remove a
package from your application dependencies Difio creates a history record.
As always, don't forget to re-run the registration script or to manually refresh
your apps after changing the dependencies!

Every application starts with a single history record, reflecting its latest state.
Later you can review your app history and revert to previously used versions
for example. Difio is planning to add more goodies to the history page in a future
release. If you have an idea and want us to implement it, please post it on the
[ideas dashboard](http://www.dif.io/#ideas)!


This new functionality is accessible on the application details view via the
*Last check-in* hyperlink, as shown below.

We encourage developers from all backgrounds and languages to [register](http://www.dif.io/register/)
their applications and send us their feedback via [GitHub](https://github.com/difio/difio/issues/new)
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DifioNews).
