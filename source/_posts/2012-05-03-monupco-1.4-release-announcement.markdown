Today [Monupco](http://monupco.com) is pleased to announce version 1.4
of our updates monitoring service. Monupco provides user friendly interface to
available updates for your cloud applications and information about different
package versions.

This release adds support for [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/) and
new registration agents for [dotCloud](http://dotcloud.com) and
[OpenShift](http://openshift.redhat.com) Ruby applications. See
[how to register applications](http://monupco.com/register/) page for more information.

There have been lots of bug fixes and improvements behind the scenes.
Since the [1.3 release](/blog/2012/04/02/monupco-1.3-release-announcement/)
we have significantly increased the number of updates processed by the service.
Currently new package versions are detected and published every day.
Monupco has already produced detailed information for 1600+
[updates](https://monupco-otb.rhcloud.com/updates/).

There were some changes to our web site to provide faster page load times:

* Static files are now served from *Amazon CloudFront*;
* Individual update pages use *JSONP* to dynamically load the content.
