Today [Difio](http://www.dif.io) is pleased to announce API diff support
for Java and PHP programming languages.

The API diff feature extracts class and method signatures and compares the
results between an older and a newer version. If API has changed this
is a good indicator that there were substantial changes in the new package
version, which require through testing.

With this release API diff becomes available for source code written in
Java, PHP and Python. We are looking to support other languages as well.
