[SofiaValley](http://sofiavalley.com) is a Bulgarian blog focused on the
IT life in the Sofia valley :). Today they announced a new section called
SV startups which will be focusing on startups and interesting projects in
the region.

We are happy that Difio is the first startup to be featured on their website
and hope that there will be many others. Kudos to SofiaValley!
