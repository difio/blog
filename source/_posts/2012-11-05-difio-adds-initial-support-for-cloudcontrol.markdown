Today [Difio](http://www.dif.io) is pleased to announce initial
support for [cloudControl](http://cloudcontrol.com). Difio provides insight of available
updates for open source components. It lets you inspect changes and take
informed decision when or what to upgrade. This improves software life cycle
planning and minimizes possible regressions and downtime.

We have added two new registration scripts allowing *cloudControl* developers to
subscribe their applications to Difio. At the moment there is support for
[Python](https://github.com/difio/difio-cloudcontrol-python/blob/master/README.rst) and
[Ruby](https://github.com/difio/difio-cloudcontrol-ruby/blob/master/README.md)
programming languages. Difio is working together with *cloudControl* to add support
for Java and PHP as well, so stay tuned!

We encourage developers who use *cloudControl* to [register](http://www.dif.io/register/)
their applications and send us their feedback via [GitHub](https://github.com/difio/difio/issues/new)
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DifioNews).
