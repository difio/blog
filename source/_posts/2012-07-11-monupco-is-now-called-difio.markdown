We are pleased to announce that our updates monitoring service previously called
Monupco has a new name. It is now called Difio and lives at <http://www.dif.io>.

All data and user accounts have been migrated. Old web addreses have been updated
to redirect to the new address. You will see the changes in effect after the DNS
system propagates the new values across the world.

We kindly ask those of you, who are using our registration agents to register their
applications to the service to start using the new agents which can be found on
[this page](http://www.dif.io/register/). If you have imported you applications manually,
no action is needed.

New data and updates will be published under the <http://www.dif.io> domain. Please
update your bookmarks. Email notifications will continue to work and will contain the
new addresses as well.

We have updated our Twitter account as well. Please follow [@DifioNews](http://twitter.com/DifioNews)
for the latest updates.

Along all these changes we have announced our public beta availability. For more information
please go to <http://dif.io/blog/2012/07/11/difio-1.6-public-beta-release-announcement>
