Today [Monupco](http://monupco.com) is pleased to announce the general availability
of our updates monitoring service. Monupco provides user friendly interface to
monitor available updates for your cloud applications and information about different
package versions.


This is an alpha release for early adopters. Currently we support registration of
Python applications hosted on Red Hat's [OpenShift Express](http://openshift.redhat.com)
platform. Client side tools and installation information can be found at our
[GitHub page](https://github.com/monupco/monupco-openshift-express-python).


Monupco itself is developed in the cloud, for the cloud. We're working to support
additional cloud vendors and more programming languages. Your feedback is valuable to us!
We welcome your feature requests on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/monupco) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/monupco/monupco.github.com/issues/new).


Monupco will remain free of charge until it reaches production-ready quality, when
subscription plans will be announced. A gratis period and/or bonus credits will be made
available to all early birds at that time.

We provide simplified registration and log in into our management console using
credentials from popular social networking providers.
