Today [Difio](http://www.dif.io) is pleased to announce our new subscription
plans - *Amber*, *Travis* and *Beaker*.

Effective immediately all [upgrade analytics](http://www.dif.io/analytics/) will be 
accessible to everyone with a cut-off based on the package release date.
If you upgrade your apps frequently this will keep bugs away and not cost you a
dime. On the other hand the older the packages you use, the more you will have
to pay to access the upgrade analytics.

What Subscription Plans Are Available
--------------------------------------

* *Amber* - free - allows access to analytics for packages released in the last six months!
* *Travis* - $ 1 per month - allows access to analytics for packages older than six months!
* *Beaker* - $ 10 per month - allows access to analytics for packages older than one year!

The default subscription plan is Amber however you may upgrade or downgrade
between Beaker and Travis as you see fit.
More information about subscriptions is available at
[your profile page](https://difio-otb.rhcloud.com/profiles/mine/).

How It Works
-------------

Difio already color codes installed packages in App Details view. See our
[previous post](/2013/09/10/latest-changes-and-deprecated-functionality/)
about this. Subscription plans cut-off access based on the release date of the
currently installed package.

As seen above, Amber plan only allows access to upgrade analytics for packages
released in the last six months.

!["Travis"](/images/subscriptions/travis.png "Travis")

With the Travis plan access is granted to upgrade analytics for packages
released in the past one year. Everything older than one year is disabled!

!["Beaker"](/images/subscriptions/beaker.png "Beaker")

Beaker plan allows access to everything. Compare with the image for Travis plan,
this is the same application as seen under the two subscription plans.

Other Changes
-------------

There have been lots of minor bug fixes and improvements in the last couple
of months. Most notable is the website optimization for mobile devices. You
can now check your apps status on your smart phone as well.

What's Next
-----------

As
[announced](/2013/08/21/important-changes-to-difio-registration-subscriptions-open-source/)
previously Difio will open source its code base. We have already started cleaning up
and refactoring some internal code. Our plan is to have as much as possible of the code
open until Christmas 2013 so stay tuned!
