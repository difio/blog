Today [Difio](http://www.dif.io) is pleased to announce version 1.6
of our updates monitoring service. Difio provides insight of available
updates for open source components. It lets you inspect changes and take
informed decision when or what to upgrade. This improves software life cycle
planning and minimizes possible regressions and downtime.

This release inludes tons of bug fixes and improvements to the service.
Suport for manually importing packages is available as well. If you are not
able to install any of our registration agents you can manually import a list
of name/version pairs and follow updates for them. This functionality is available
for Python, Ruby, Perl and Node.js environments. See
[how to register applications](http://www.dif.io/register/) page for more information.

With this release Difio enters Public Beta and registration is open to everyone.
We encourage developers of all backgrounds to [register](http://www.dif.io/register/)
their applications and send us their feedback via [GitHub](https://github.com/difio/bugs/issues/new)
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DifioNews).
