The folks at [Xeround](http://xeround.com) have compiled a pretty good list of
[43 cloud computing services](http://xeround.com/blog/2012/08/43-free-cloud-resources-for-application-developers)
that can make life easier for application developers â€“ all free of charge.
The list is organized by categories: cloud IDEs, source code management,
issue tracking, cloud and open source databases, CMS, payment gateways,
IaaS and PaaS, load testing, monitoring, knowledge base and web analytics.

They are missing some vendors however. Here's a list of some resources that [Difio](http://www.dif.io)
is using:

* [OpenShift](http://openshift.redhat.com) - PaaS platform by *Red Hat* which is our primary resource;
* [dotCloud](http://dotcloud.com) - another PaaS service;
* [Heroku](http://heroku.com) - a popular PaaS vendor, especially among Ruby developers;
* [Twillio](http://twillio.com) - cloud communications service.
* [HP Cloud](http://hpcloud.com) - IaaS vendor that runs on [KVM](http://linux-kvm.org).

We're especially interested in what other PaaS platforms developers are using. Please let us know
what is your programming language and platform in the comments!
