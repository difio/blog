Today [Difio](http://www.dif.io) is pleased to announce version 1.2
of our updates monitoring service. Difio provides user friendly interface to
monitor available updates for your cloud applications and information about different
package versions.

This release adds support for [NodeJS](http://npmjs.org) packages. We've
aready imported 1000 of the most dependent upon packages and started to process updates.
Difio has already produced detailed information for 60+ updates.

Client side registration tool for NodeJS applications hosted at [dotCloud](http://dotcloud.com) has
been added as well. It is contributed and maintained by [Svetlozar Argirov](http://github.com/zaro).
For more information see the [register](http://www.dif.io/register/) page.

Small improvements to the web interface were made:

* Added pagination to the advisories and application details pages;
* Added buttons to show only packages which need updates in application details page;
* Added buttons to filter applications by status.

In the next weeks we're looking to enable support for Ruby, PHP, Perl and Java and extend
client side tools to more vendors. Stay [tuned](https://twitter.com/difio) if you don't
want to miss the announcement.
